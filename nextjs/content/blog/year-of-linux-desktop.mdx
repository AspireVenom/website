# Stop Waiting for the Year of the Linux Desktop  
*It’s not coming. It’s already here.*

Windows 10 is dead.  
October 14th, 2025 — the official end of support and the unofficial start of clarity.  

Millions of users finally faced the question:  
**“Do I upgrade to Windows 11 — or finally install that Linux distro I bookmarked from r/unixporn?” [UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)**

They stared down TPM chips, forced Microsoft accounts, telemetry,  
and a UI designed more for ads, babying the USER and making ASSUMPTIONS for them, than it ever was about the developer.  

So they left — not in protest, but in fatigue.  
And on the other side, they found **Linux**.

## The Quiet Revolution

No keynote.  
No billion-dollar rebrand.  
Just a quiet migration... *one developer, one student, one tired user at a time.*  

If you're reading this, and you've previously made the migration, and disliked it.
I urge you to give it another chance. Depending on your understanding of Linux, I think a good starting point
is DHH's [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/). It gives Engineers complete ease in the installation of arch, no longer are you 
expected to spend ~5 hours getting drivers to work. The process is extremely simple via Omarchy, and an AMAZING starting point.

From Omarchy, you can easily decide if you want to dive into the world of configurations and rice your workstation, or you can
simply accept DHH's approach to Linux, and come to find out that Windows was the worst OS you could have possibly been using.

## The Journey

For me, it wasn’t some grand switch, it was actually incredibly gradual.  
At first, I was dual-booting Arch and Windows, falling back to WSL 2.0 on Windows when I felt like using Windows, and 
slowly finding, that I was booting into Windows less and less, as the productivity gain of using Arch Linux was far greater in comparison.  

Every time I booted into Linux, things just worked better, faster, and really overall just felt like home.  

I found myself justifying keeping Windows around, and the sole excuse was for playing those few videogames, you know the type,
the one's that require kernal level anticheat, Riot games (Valorant, League of Legends), Apex Legends, Escape from Tarkov,
the games that are low-key spying on you, and we MUST allow them Kernal level access because they said so...
Yea, when I said that out-loud, I realized that it was time to let Windows go, and move to much greener pastures over on Linux.

## The Future Will Never be Announced

Linux did not win because it finally "Caught up to" Windows.  
It won because it did the complete opposite that Microsoft was attempting to do.

Bloated updates.  
Forced MICROSOFT accounts.  
Advertisements on the Start Menu, in Edge — and the irony that it is in an operating system you *paid for*!

While everyone else built walls, Linux broke them.  

So stop waiting for “the year.” You're doing yourself an injustice.
