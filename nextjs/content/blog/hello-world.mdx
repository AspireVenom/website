# Hello, World

Welcome to my **very** minimal blog. Expect concise notes VERY occasionally on engineering and products, but nothing except my honest thoughts and opinions.

I will try to be keeping everything as concise, and to the point, but please remember that I am human,
and will likely have many of my own biases.
I urge most of you to take the concepts and takes, and build upon them, not take them as gospel.
I find that for myself, the best way to learn is to read articles in subjects that deeply interest me,
and definitely hear perspectives I may have never considered, and then likely dive into a rabbit hole, at which points, I will form my own opinions!

```ts
export const ethos = "minimal, precise, and deeply passionate";
```

I am always reachable!
